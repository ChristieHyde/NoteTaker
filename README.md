Users can view all of their notes on the side panel. Clicking one will bring it to the main section of the webpage to be viewed in full.
Clicking the New Note button will display empty title and text fields for a user to type in the contents of the note. Once the note is written, it can be saved to the server by clicking the Save Note button. Alternatively, the Clear Form button will remove all text from the draft note.
